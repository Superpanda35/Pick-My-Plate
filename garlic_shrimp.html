 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>1 1/2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
 <li>1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
 <li>salt to taste</li>
 <li>6 gloves garlic, finely minced</li>
 <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
 <li>13 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
 <li>1 tablespoon caper brine</li>
 <li>1 1/2 cold butter</li>
 <li>1/3 cup chopped Italian flat leaf parsley, divided</li>
 <li>1 water as needed</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Directions</h2>
 <ol>
 <li>Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet over high heat until it just begins to smoke. Place shrimp in an even layer on the bottom of the pan and cook for 1 minute without stirring.</li>
 <li>Season shrimp with salt; cook and stir until shrimp begin to turn pink, about 1 minute.</li>
 <li>Stir in garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir 1 minute. Stir in lemon juice, caper brine, 1 1/2 teaspoon cold butter, and half the parsley.</li>
 <li>Cook until butter has melted, about 1 minute, then turn heat to low and stir in 1 1/2 tablespoon cold butter. Cook and stir until all butter has melted to form a thick sauce and shrimp are pink and opaque, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
 <li>Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl; continue to cook butter sauce, adding water 1 teaspoon at a time if too thick, about 2 minutes. Season with salt to taste.</li>
