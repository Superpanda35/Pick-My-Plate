 Ingredients
 1 1/2 tablespoon olive oil
 1 pound shrimp peeled and deveined
 salt to taste
 6 gloves garlic finely minced
 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
 13 tablespoons lemon juice
 1 tablespoon caper brine
 1 1/2 cold butter
 1/3 cup chopped Italian flat leaf parsley, divided
 1 water as needed
 
 Directions
 1.Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet over high heat until it just begins to smoke. Place shrimp in an even layer on the bottom of the pan and cook for 1 minute without stirring.
 2.Season shrimp with salt; cook and stir until shrimp begin to turn pink, about 1 minute.
 3.Stir in garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir 1 minute. Stir in lemon juice, caper brine, 1 1/2 teaspoon cold butter, and half the parsley.
 4.Cook until butter has melted, about 1 minute, then turn heat to low and stir in 1 1/2 tablespoon cold butter. Cook and stir until all butter has melted to form a thick sauce and shrimp are pink and opaque, about 2 to 3 minutes.
 5.Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl; continue to cook butter sauce, adding water 1 teaspoon at a time if too thick, about 2 minutes. Season with salt to taste.
 6.Serve shrimp topped with the pan sauce. Garnish with remaining flat-leaf parsley.
